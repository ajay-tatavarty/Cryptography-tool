# Advanced Cryptography Tool

A web-based application for encrypting and decrypting text using various cryptographic techniques, including Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, brute-force analysis, and file encryption. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a responsive dark-mode UI and advanced security features.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Encrypt/decrypt with custom shifts or password-derived shifts (SHA-256), multi-layer encryption (3 passes), and frequency analysis.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: Encrypt/decrypt using a keyword.
- **Brute Force**: Test all possible Caesar Cipher shifts (0-25) to crack encrypted text.
- **File Encryption**: Encrypt/decrypt text files using a password-derived Caesar Cipher shift.
- **Security**: Input sanitization, secure password handling, and SHA-256 for shift derivation.
- **UI/UX**: Responsive tabbed interface, dark theme, clipboard integration, and mobile support.
- **Additional Tools**: Frequency analysis, real-time feedback, and browser compatibility.
